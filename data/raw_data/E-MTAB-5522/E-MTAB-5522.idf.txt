Comment[Submitted Name]	Assessing the reliability of spike-in normalization for analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data
Experiment Description	This study aims to assess the reliability of spike-in normalization for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data. This is done by performing mixture experiments where two different sets of spike-in RNA (ERCC and SIRV) are added separately to a single mouse cell (416B or trophoblast stem cells (TSCs)), followed by generation of sequencing libraries using a modified version of the Smart-seq2 protocol. The aim is to measure the variance of the log-ratio of the total counts between the two spike-in sets. This will quantify how precisely the spike-in RNA was added to each well. As a control, addition was also performed with a premixed solution of both spike-ins, to quantify the variability in the log-ratios due to the experimental protocol. The same data can also be used to measure the well-to-well variability in the differences in behaviour between the two spike-in sets. The data contain four batches of libraries (block), using different batches of cells that were processed and sequenced separately. Each batch contains libraries with all three types of spike-in addition (ERCC+SIRV, SIRV+ERCC or Premixed). The 416B cells also contain a CBFB-MYH11 oncogene, which is expressed in half of the cells (Induced) and silent in the other half (Control).

Protocol Description	The murine multipotent myeloid progenitor cell line 416B was stably transduced with a TetOn construct of the Cbfb-Myh11 (CM) oncogene (type A cDNA), using an in-frame F2A-mCherry protein as a reporter. As a control, cells were alternatively transduced with a version of the construct lacking the CM cDNA.	Murine TSCs were kindly provided by Dr. Jennifer Nichols.	416B cells were maintained in RPMI medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Expression of the CM oncogene or mCherry was induced by treatment with 1 ug/ml of doxycycline, and induction was confirmed after 24 hours by measurement of mCherry levels by fluorescence activated cell sorting.	TSCs were cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeders with TSC culturing medium (a combination of 70% MEF conditioned media (R&D systems) and 30% RPMI 1640, supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 uM B-mercaptoethanol, 25 ng/mL human recombinant FGF4 (R&D systems) and 1 ug/mL heparin (Tocris Bioscience)). To prepare for single-cell sorting, cells were harvested with trypsin and MEF feeders were depleted by plating the cells onto a gelatinised plate followed by incubation for 1h at 37 degrees C on TSC culturing medium. The supernatant containing TSCs was used for sorting.	Cells were sorted into individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. Each well contained 2.3 ul of lysis buffer with RNAse inhibitor (Ambion) in a 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 solution.	Preamplification was performed in a total volume of 27 ul that contained 13.5 ul of HiFi Hotstart ReadyMix (2x; KAPA Biosystems) and 0.1 uM of IS PCR primer (Sigma-Aldrich). After 23 cycles of amplification, samples were cleaned with 80% (v/v) of Ampure beads (Beckman Coulter). Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina).	Libraries for batch 20160113 were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 to obtain 125 bp single-end reads. 	 Libraries for batch 20160325 were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 to obtain 50 bp single-end reads. Libraries for batches 20160906 and 20170201 were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 to obtain 75 bp paired-end reads.	Reads were aligned to the mm10 build of the mouse genome using subread v1.5.0 in RNA-seq mode with unique mapping. The number of reads or read pairs mapped to the exonic regions of each gene was then counted for each library, using the featureCounts function in Rsubread v1.24.1 with Ensembl GRCm38 version 82. Only alignments with mapping quality scores above 10 were considered during counting.	Reverse transcription was performed in a final volume of 13.2 ul per well, containing 1 uM of oligo-dT (Sigma-Aldrich), 1.04 mM of each dNTP (ThermoFisher), 100 U of SuperScript II retrotranscriptase (Invitrogen/ThermoFisher), 5 U of RNase inhibitor (Ambion), 5 mM of DTT, 1 M of Betaine (Sigma-Alrich), 6 mM of MgCl$_2$ (Ambion) and 1 uM of TSO primer (Exiqon). Spike-in RNA was added such that each well contained a final volume of 0.1 ul of a 1:3,000,000 dilution of the ERCC RNA Spike-In Mix (Invitrogen/ThermoFisher) and 0.12 ul of a 1:3,000,000 dilution of the Spike-in RNA Variant (SIRV) Control Mix E0 (Lexogen).
